# YOURA (Your - Aura)

Mackenna

## Planning:

### Concept/Name
**YOURA** is a social media platform designed to inspire and promote kindness through Random Acts of Kindness (RAKs). Users can post either requests or offers of a RAK, claim acts to fulfil, and earn aura points, which represent their contribution to the kindness community. The more RAKs a user performs, the higher their aura level grows, symbolised by visual elements such as glowing avatars or badges.

The app integrates social media features, allowing users to follow others, share posts, upload media, and comment on acts of kindness. It encourages users to pay it forward after receiving a RAK, ensuring that kindness spreads throughout the community. With a focus on positive interactions, users can take part in kindness challenges, earn achievements, and build an inspiring feed of their contributions.

The app fosters a supportive environment where users can track their impact, connect with like-minded individuals, and share their journey toward making the world a kinder place, all while maintaining privacy and control over their profiles and posts.

### Intended Audience/User Stories
- **Intended Audience**: The intended audience for YOURA includes individuals who are passionate about community service, random acts of kindness, and social responsibility.

  - As a user, I want to request help through a Random Act of Kindness when I need support.
  - As a user, I want to claim an existing offer so I can help someone in need.
  - As a user, I want to earn aura points and badges for completing acts of kindness to track my contributions.
